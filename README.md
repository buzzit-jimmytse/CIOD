# CIOD: Class Incremental Object Detector

## Introduction

Based on Faster R-CNN, CIOD can add new class to a well-trained object detector, only use data of new classes.

## Preparation

First of all, clone the code
```
git clone https://github.com/jinyu121/CIOD-FasterRCNN
```

Then, create a folder:
```
cd faster-rcnn.pytorch && mkdir data
```

And setup the environment:

* Python3
* PyTorch
* CUDA 8.0 or higher


Install all the python dependencies using conda:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml --name ciod-faster
```

Compile the cuda dependencies using following simple commands:

```
cd lib && ./make.sh
```

## Train

### Split the dataset

We split the classes of the dataset into `class group`s. For example, Pascal VOC dataset have 20 classes, and we split the classes into 4 class groups equally.

Then, we select pictures for each group in the whole dataset, forming `image group`s. Each image group will only contains pictures who only contains objects in the corresponding class group.

We can do it using `select_pic.py`.

### Train

```
python3 ./trainval_net.py --session 10000
```

## Test

```
python3 ./test_net.py --session 10000 --no_repr
```
